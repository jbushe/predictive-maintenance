# Predictive Maintenance on Bearings using Vibration Signals

This is an exercise project that aims to detect a faulty bearing based on vibration signals. We use this dataset https://data.nasa.gov/Raw-Data/IMS-Bearings/brfb-gzcv/about_data .

This work is based on work done in a group project at LeWagon which itself was based on https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-machine-learning-for-anomaly-detection-and-condition-monitoring-6742f82900d7 .
